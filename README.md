# Welcome to OpenRec Deluxe!
---
OpenRec is a RecRoom server software made by recroom2016... but then abandoned for old Gorilla Tag. Then when they went back to old RR the decided to creade a brand new closed server. This is an update to openrec made by me, CoffeeMan.

### Q&A
 - Why remake openrec? do you have your own server?
    
    Yes, I'm remaking openrec mainly because it was a decent enough old rr server, as well as the only one that was atually open source and not just putting open in the name as a buzz word meaning nothing about being open-source *cough cough* openlabs *cough cough*
- is amogus sus?
    yes.

### Getting in contact with the community

If you are nostalgic for OpenRec, I recommend you joining the OpenRec Discord for original builds of this server.

If you love giving Openlabs "no monitary gain" via boosting, join their lying ass server.

If you want my original CoffeeVault, Want to play scuffed versions of 2019 and 2020, or want to atually have a good server that doesn't require boosting to test a free game, join rec noot.

Link: Request CoffeeMan#2926 for it due to Openlabs fucking hating me and wanting my server down.
